#NOTE: Ideally a user_command will look like: "definition": "command_string"
#       parameters with an '=' sign are optional and the value after the = are

#      "!go #(seconds=1)": ":set smooth_movement 1; :tilt x 1.0 #(seconds); :set smooth_movement 0"
#      "!a #(times=1) #(delay=1.5)": ":mash 1 #(times) #(delay) 1"
#TODO: implement CommandParser

#NOTE:      Ideally a twitch_command_string would look like this:
#      "!go; !a; !b 1 3; !x; !y"

#NOTE: create a list of user defined button aliases.
#       this way a user can define a command such as;
#       "!push #(button)": ":mash #(button)"
#       then an alias to map button 1 to a in an alias config.
#       "a": 1
#       then a twitch user will be able to use;
#       !push a
#       and it will be the equivalent of !push 1
